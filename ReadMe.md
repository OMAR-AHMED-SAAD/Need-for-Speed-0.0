## Bonus Feature
In Level 2, we've introduced an exciting new challenge. A character appears randomly on the road at different intervals. This character will pop up in random positions, adding an element of unpredictability to the game. The twist? If your car hits this character, you immediately lose the game. This feature demands heightened awareness and quick reflexes, offering an extra layer of challenge and excitement for players.
